METHODOLOGY 
  Proposed System: In remote regions with inadequate healthcare infrastructure, drones can transport essential medical supplies, medications to people in need. The sensors implemented in the drone can also able to predict the disease immediately using RF and can prescribe the medicine. If the medicine is carried out by the drone in the emergency kit the drone will give the medicine to the affected patient. If not available in the medical kit the message will passed to the command center and also to emergency ambulance
    Getting Services from Cloud:
	Platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) can provide scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure for storing and processing medical data, as well as running applications.	Serverless computing platform AWS Lambda are used for running event-driven applications and services that respond rapidly to emergency situations.
  2.  Creating Handy Doc Application:
	After the creation of the model and development of the ML Application, the input is directly taken in using the sensors integrated with the smart watch instead of manually collecting it by the user.
 3. Embedding Sensors with Smart Watch:
The instrument consists of a single-use chip, the size of a credit card, pre-loaded with reagents, in which the sample is loaded, and which is fluidically insulated from the environment. One microliter of blood of a normal patient contains about 4.5–6×106 red blood cells (RBCs/erythrocytes) which are disk-like with diameter about 8μm and thickness 2μm, about 4,000–10,000 white blood cells (WBCs/ leukocytes) of size 10–20μm, and about 1.5–4.5×105 platelets of size 2–3μm. 
4. Implementing AI- based Real Time diagnostic System 
It is built using prediction based on the analyzation of the result obtained for the prevailed dataset using decision tree and further by implementing the random forest classifier technique. The developed model has shown 85% accuracy for the detection of diseases such as dengue. The application is currently under development and being tested for compatibility with 11 sensors that is supposed to be integrated with the smart watches for easy access towards health checkup and instant detection of ailment. GIS Mapping: Utilize GIS technologies to track the location of ambulances, healthcare facilities, and patients, optimizing response times and resource allocation.
5.Telemedicine and Remote Monitoring: - Video Conferencing: Integrate video conferencing solutions for remote medical consultations and diagnoses. - Remote Monitoring Devices: Incorporate remote monitoring devices for patients with chronic conditions, allowing healthcare providers to track their health remotely.
